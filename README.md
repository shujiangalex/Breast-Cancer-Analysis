# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to identify the best model to be used for diagnosing breast cancer.
The project will investigate the visualization of the FNA of the breast mass with computational interpretation using machine learning techniques, and identify the model that provides the highest level of accuracy. 
The model built through this project has the potential to be used in identifying breast cancer in the real world. The results of this project may also be beneficial to the doctors in making decisions about the patientâ€™s treatment options.
